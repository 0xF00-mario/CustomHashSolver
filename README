Descriptions:
(MD5) I used hashcat and with the parameters of -m 0 -a 3
        These parameters mean that it will crack MD5 using
        a brute force attack but I also used a mask.
        Using a mask I was able to reduce the search space
        mask I used: ?a?a?a?a?a?a
        this mask is all characters and a length of 6 (given).
(SHA256) Using hashcat, I specified my attack mode to 1400 for sha256
         the attack mode was bruteforce but I provided a mask to reduce
         the search space. First I defined a character set for all upper,
         lower, and numeric values the password. The mask uses the custom
         character set and constraints the password to be of length 7.
         I used a .hcmask file which contained the following line:
        ?l?u?d,?1?1?1?1?1?1?1
(BCRYPT) using hashcat, I launched a dictionary attack under the parameters
         -m 3200 and -a 0 for dict attack. The wordlist that I used was
         the famous kalilinux wordlist rockyou.txt. I downloaded the file from kaggle.
         hashcat was able to find a common match welcome which is also in the rock you.txt file.
